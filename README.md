# Need for Speed: Undercover DLC Unlocker

This is a plugin that hooks Need for Speed: Undercover DLC system, allowing you to unlock DLC content without modifying the game's assets. By default, it unlocks Collector's Edition Upgrade and Boss Cars Bundle.

**Please note that this plugin only supports v1.0.1.18 nfs.exe (either retail version with the latest patch installed or EA App version). Older game versions will not work since they don't have a DLC system implemented. That includes Steam version.**

## Usage

1. Extract all files from the [latest release](https://github.com/NicknineTheEagle/NFSUndercoverDLCUnlocker/releases/latest) into the game directory.

2. (OPTIONAL) Edit scripts\dlc.txt and add the internal names of any unlocks you wish to obtain. You can find known DLC unlock lists in dlc_examples directory.

3. Play the game. DLC content should become available immediately, you do not need to create a new save file.
